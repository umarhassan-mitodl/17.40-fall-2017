*Your instructor's summary of the argument that states are more belligerent and war is more likely when conquest is easy. A key related argument: international conflict arises largely from the "security dilemma"-­ the tendency of states to threaten others' security by their efforts to secure themselves.*

*Can the U.S. prevent war by making conquest hard in world trouble-spots? Have America's past conflict with others arisen from the security dilemma?*

Walt, Stephen M. "Explaining Alliance Formation." Chapter 2 in The *Origins of Alliances*. Cornell University Press, 1990. ISBN: 9780801494185. 

*Walt presents competing hypotheses on how states choose their friends. Which hypotheses are valid? Do your answers matter for the kind of foreign policy you would recommend?*

*Claimed here: during political campaigns U.S. politicians pander to U.S. voters by framing dangerous foreign policy positions that they cannot abandon once in office. The country is thereby led into folly. A corollary: a prime threat to America is … an American public that responds well to irresponsible pandering.*

*Governments misperceive the world if their intelligence agencies misreport foreign realities. This can happen if government leaders press their intelligence agencies to tell the leaders what they want to hear regardless of the facts.*

*Some ("spiral model" advocates) say international conflict is best resolved by the carrot, while using the stick merely provokes; others ("deterrence" advocates) would use the stick, warning that offering carrots ("appeasement") leads others to make more demands. Who's right? Probably both--but under what circumstances? And how can you tell which circumstances you face?*

*Why do spirals happen? Gilbert describes research noting that people underestimate their own aggressive conduct and exaggerate others' aggressive conduct. This makes for conflict spirals.*

*Does the American foreign policy elite share America's wider democratic values? We learn here that George Kennan thought women, blacks, and immigrants should be denied the vote; Kennan and Dean Acheson saw little wrong with the white minority governments in Rhodesia and South Africa; and John McCloy adopted the cause of Iran's Pahlevi family. Not your typical League of Women Voters views.*

*The study of political, diplomatic and military history is being marginalized or destroyed in American universities. Some find this dangerous.

*Unlike other major powers the United States allows foreign lobbies free run of its national capitol. These foreign lobbies have large influence on US foreign policy. Is this a good idea? Do foreigners have Americans' best interests at heart? The answer is no.*

### *Cold War-era (1947–89) national security strategy ideas*

\[G\] Chapter 1: Prologue: Containment Before Kennan.

\[G\] Chapter 2: George F. Kennan and the Strategy of Containment.

*In Chapter 2, Gaddis explicates his ideas.*

### *George W. Bush-era (2001–09) national security strategy ideas, debates*

Sanger, David E. "{{% resource_link "304c0412-faae-49f1-8f45-5dc73137670e" "Bush to Formalize A Defense Policy of Hitting First" %}}," *New York Times,* June 17, 2002.

*The George W. Bush Administration embraced a general doctrine of preventive war against rogue states that aspire to develop weapons of mass destruction. Iraq was the first rogue state on its hit list: Syria and Iran were also high on the list; Libya and Saudi Arabia were further down. Are such preventive wars a good idea?*

Lieber, Keir A. and Robert J. Lieber. {{% resource_link "8bd9bc1e-e806-45af-bd24-6cad786289d0" "\"The Bush National Security Strategy.\" (PDF)" %}} *U.S. Foreign Policy Agenda, An Electronic Journal of the U.S. Department of State* 7, no. 4 (December 2002): 32–35.

*A friendly summary and assessment of the* {{% resource_link "40025a1e-51b9-4d5e-bc33-0cebeb563bbd" "*National Security Strategy of the United States of America (Washington D.C.: White House, September 2002)*" %}}*, the document that frames the main elements of the George W. Bush administration strategy, including its general doctrine of preventive war (see Sanger article above).*

Baker, Kevin. "{{% resource_link "4f9a3217-4235-45de-b2d9-422b1048e62a" "American Imperialism, Embraced" %}}," *New York Times Magazine,* December 9, 2001.

Ricks, Thomas E. "{{% resource_link "e49c542b-d85a-4735-b3df-412d88cd8ad7" "Empire or Not? A Quiet Debate Over U.S. Role" %}}," *Washington Post,* August 21, 2001.

*After 2000, important elements of the U.S. conservative movement began arguing for a U.S. empire. Do Tom Donnelly and William Kristal have a good idea?*

### *Obama-era (2009–17) national security strategy ideas, debates:*

Sanger, David E., and Peter Baker. "{{% resource_link "2f991299-0c41-4175-8224-dcb14e33609e" "New U.S. Strategy Focuses on Managing Threats" %}}," *New York Times,* May 27, 2010.

*The Obama administration national security strategy dropped the George W. Bush administration's unilateralist approach in favor of pursuing common action, and it downgraded the Bush emphasis on preventive war. It focused on preventing terror, limiting the spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and halting climate change.*

### *Trump-era (2017–) national security strategy ideas, debates*

Kahl, Colin, and Hal Brands. "{{% resource_link "c94faec1-a737-471c-972d-349bdf98f8de" "Trump's Grand Strategic Train Wreck: Believe It or Not, the President has a Grand Strategy. But it's a Nightmarish Mess" %}}." *Foreign Policy,* January 31, 2017.

*Please read only the first half of this essay, roughly pages 1–7, up to the section heading reading "Trump's Grand Strategic Dilemmas." The Trump administration sees three overriding threats to the U.S.: radical Islam, unfair trade deals (especially with China), and illegal immigration. The administration offers four strategies to address these threats: extreme homeland security measures, trade protectionism, alliances with dictators like Russia's Putin while downgrading U.S. democratic allies (NATO states) and coercing these allies to contribute more military power, and heavy reliance on the use of force as a policy tool. Trump's focus on the radical Islam threat echoes Bush 43 and Obama; other focuses are new.*

Sanger, David E. "{{% resource_link "b4c1dfa1-63b2-4194-9448-c518929e49ae" "Talk of 'Preventive War' Rises in White House Over North Korea" %}}," *New York Times,* August 20, 2017.

*Preventive war is back! Unlike Obama officials, some Trump officials think that North Korea cannot be deterred or contained in the way the Soviet Union and China were deterred and contained; and that military action to destroy North Korea's nuclear forces is feasible at acceptable cost. Hence these Trump officials think the U.S. should launch preventive war against North Korea.*

versus

Rice, Susan E. "{{% resource_link "f017f729-4864-4482-b25c-541147582238" "It's Not Too Late on North Korea" %}}," *New York Times*, August 10, 2017.

*Rice argues that preventive war against North Korea would be very costly, and would risk war with China. Moreover, North Korea can be deterred and contained, and eventually persuaded to halt its nuclear program, by economic sanction and carrots. Preventive war "would be lunacy."*

### *National security strategies from academe*

Dizikes, Peter. "{{% resource_link "27356037-1fc9-4678-bc2c-19879da9baec" "Time to Rethink Foreign Policy?" %}}" MIT News, July 9, 2014.

*Political scientist and MIT professor* {{% resource_link "326fdc85-faca-4c66-9d4e-5c7951b29f7f" "*Barry Posen*" %}} *argues for a more limited U.S. grand strategy in an important book,* Restraint: A New Foundation for U.S. Grand Strategy. *Cornell University Press, 2015. ISBN: 9781501700729. \[Preview with* {{% resource_link "859ed84f-0278-47ec-a3d2-1ecc9c938cd3" "*Google Books*" %}}*\] The U.S. should prevent any state from dominating industrial Eurasia, but that's an easy task--there is no candidate for Eurasian hegemony today. The U.S. should also work to limit nuclear proliferation and to destroy terrorist groups that aim to harm the U.S., but that's easy too. It doesn't require a wide U.S. empire and is best achieved by largely nonmilitary means. Invading Iraq was a bad idea: avoid similar projects down the road.*

 Van Evera, Stephen, ed. {{% resource_link "0338a3e9-419a-4fd5-9d8b-6bddbe578a1e" "\"American Foreign Policy for the New Era.\" (PDF)" %}} In *How to Make America Safe: New Policies for National Security.* Tobin Project, 2006. 

*The U.S. should lead in forming a concert of major powers to address the prime threats to the U.S.: the spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), terrorists like al-Qaeda who would use WMD against the U.S.; and climate change. Imperial conduct by the U.S. would preclude such a concert and should therefore be eschewed.*

### *Protecting the commons: climate change*

Frank, Robert H. "{{% resource_link "3ce371ff-52f4-49eb-80d4-03c8d0a3a5d3" "A Small Price for a Large Benefit" %}}," *New York Times,* February 21, 2010.

*Climate change is real and dangerous. We face a 10 percent chance of a catastrophic 12-degree climb in temperatures by 2100. And: we can prevent catastrophic climate change at modest cost. Maybe we should do it!*

Homer-Dixon, Thomas. "{{% resource_link "26bbc24c-4c44-4c3b-b24d-1e474a2e9f62" "Terror in the Weather Forecast" %}}," *New York Times,* April 24, 2007.

*Climate change will cause failed states, terrorism, and vast forced migrations, triggering civil and international war. How cheery.*

Davenport, Coral. "{{% resource_link "11a7fd4c-5e7f-4243-b37d-fb540b73bb9a" "Climate Change Deemed Growing Security Threat by Military Researchers" %}},'' *New York Times,* May 14, 2014.

{{% resource_link "650dce54-cd49-409a-ad87-567b8743a3eb" "*The Center for Naval Analyses*" %}} *warns that climate change will disrupt other societies in ways that will cause conflict, war, refugees, and chaos overseas, and will do damage to U.S. military infrastructure in the U.S. U.S. national security will suffer.*

Romm, Joe. "{{% resource_link "4143fdd5-342d-4189-839a-4600d3cf318a" "Climate Panel Stunner: Avoiding Climate Catastrophe is Super Cheap-But Only if We Act Now" %}}." ThinkProgress, April 13, 2014.

*Action to contain climate change would not cost much. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels can be kept below 450 parts per million (a commonly accepted target) in 2100 by actions that would only shave a trivial .06 percent off the U.S. economic growth rate if we began now. Chump change! But delay will sharply raise the costs of effective action.*

### *Humanitarian intervention, debates about it*

Kaufmann, Chaim. "{{% resource_link "de2b013c-3f79-48a3-b220-0c31395c1568" "See No Evil: Why America Doesn't Stop Genocide" %}}." *Foreign Affairs,* July / August 2002.

*The U.S. could have stopped genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and elsewhere but chose not to. Good choice? Should the U.S. intervene to prevent such horrors?*

Cooper, Glenda. "U.S. Memos on Rwanda Cited," *Boston Globe,* August 23, 2001.

*More color on U.S. inaction in Rwanda.*

Kristof, Nicholas "{{% resource_link "89ed044b-00e7-4c88-a1d4-15aac0c6313e" "Yet Again in Sudan" %}}," *New York Times,* June 29, 2011.

*The ever-murderous Islamist government of Sudan conducted a 55-year killing spree against its own people, killing 1–2 million people in now­ independent South Sudan, then 300,000 in Darfur, then the Nuba people. Should something have been done?*

Kinzer, Stephen. "{{% resource_link "66acd803-0d09-4453-82da-daa45335fefa" "Are Human Rights Activists Today's Warmongers?" %}}" *Boston Globe,* May 25, 2014.

*Claimed by Kinzer: Human rights advocates now often call for war to protect human rights, e.g., in Syria, Afghanistan, South Sudan, This is unwise.* {{% resource_link "b8e5e929-bf37-420a-994a-8ddbcc03c38a" "*Human Rights Watch*" %}} *has been captured by advocates of a belligerent parochial agenda. This is bad.*

### *Protecting the commons: global public health*

Troedsson, Hans, and Anton Rychener, "{{% resource_link "75fd2bc8-0882-4620-9e43-558a142b6d7d" "When Influenza Takes Flight" %}}," *New York Times*, February 5, 2005.

*The 1918 flu killed 675,000 Americans--more than died in combat in the two World Wars combined. Bummer. Something similar could happen again. We have learned some tricks since 1918 but remain poorly prepared for another lethal flu pandemic. What's the answer? Two ideas: better vaccine manufacturing technique, and worldwide preventive action. Again, everyone must cooperate. Hence this is a foreign policy problem. What are we doing about it? Not much.*

### *Spreading democracy: a debated goal*

Kinzer, Stephen. "{{% resource_link "a93c9b3d-b843-4daf-80bf-bd49aa2303ff" "Stability Does Not Require Democracy" %}}," *Boston Globe,* August 17, 2014.

*Kinzer argues that the U.S. should not reflexively favor ousting authoritarian regimes. Often democracy won't result; and sometimes what follows will be worse. Witness Iraq 2003, Libya 2011. Regime change is difficult business. The US track record at regime change is very spotty.*

*The advance of science has a fearsome byproduct: we are discovering ever more powerful means of destruction. These destructive powers are being democratized: the mayhem that only major states can do today may lie within the capacity of millions of individuals in the future unless we somehow change course. Deterrence works against states but will fail against crazed non-state organizations or individuals. How can the spread of destructive powers be controlled?*

*The wolf that worried Henry Kelly--new ultra­ lethal biotechnology (see previous reading)--is at our door. Recent advances in gene editing, embodied in the CRISPR editing method, will spread the power to create new bioagents hither and yon, including to nihilistic terrorists and psychopaths. They will not be deterrable. The only way to reliably prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) is deterrence, but these bad actors are not deterrable.

*Is history written to emphasize the uses of force by Presidents, and to downplay their horse trading and compromise? The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis was settled by concessions from both sides, although Kennedy hid the U.S. concessions from public view and painted the outcome as a pure Soviet backdown. Smith notes that other war-hero presidents, including Grant and Eisenhower, eschewed force and cut deals at important moments, and more often than popular history remembers. U.S. Grant was a peacenick! George Washington stood against strong hawkish criticism to reach Jay's treaty, which avoided war with Britain. John Adams resisted strong demands for war with France, losing office as a result. But their policies look good in retrospect.*

*North Korea's government prefers conflict over harmony with others. It has so provoked its neighbors that it now thinks it must have nuclear weapons to be safe from them. Its military strategy features hair-trigger escalation to nuclear war at the outset of any confrontation. It has a very high threshold for the pain that economic sanctions inflict. Its nuclear weapons are now too numerous and well-hidden to be destroyed before they could be launched, so a preemptive attack on North Korea would likely involve very high costs. It will demand extravagant U.S. concessions in exchange for any deal. In short North Korea is the adversary from hell.*
